# stats220

This is my repo for STATS 220. 

A little about me:

- I am a Computer Science major specializing in Data Science
- I am currently an exchange student
- I am taking STATS 220 because I was looking for an interesting stats course and explore new perspectives on data

A meme that captures how I currently feel about my university studies is ![](https://c.tenor.com/8druEACXtX8AAAAd/tenor.gif)
